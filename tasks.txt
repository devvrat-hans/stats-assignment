Data from adoption studies on handedness indicate that the effects of shared biological heritage are more
powerful determinants of hand preference than sociocultural factors. Biological offspring were found to show
nonrandom distributions of right and non-right handedness as a function of parental handedness. In contrast, the
handedness distribution of adopted children as a function of parental handedness was essentially random. The
following table gives the handedness of biological offspring as a function of parental handedness.
Biological Offspring
Parental Handedness
(father × mother) Right-Handed Left-Handed
Right × Right 290 37
Right × Left 29 8
Left × Right 30 6

statistic?

(F) We conclude that the factors are independent since
the answer in (c) is less than or equal to the answer in (d)
(G) Do not reject the hypothesis of independence since
the answer in (c) is less than or equal to the answer in (d)


Now, lets do the problem03 of the assignment06:
A high-risk group of 784 male volunteers was included in a major clinical trial for testing a new vaccine for type
B hepatitis. The vaccine was given to 430 persons randomly selected from the group, and the others were
injected with a neutral substance (placebo). 8 of the vaccinated people and 31 of the nonvaccinated ones later got
the disease.
We wish to test the hypothesis that the probability of getting type B hepatitis is different (higher or lower) for
people who were vaccinated compared with people who were not, using the 10% significance level.
(a) If we use the contingency table method to test this hypothesis, find the 4 values in the expected table.
(b) Find the value of the test statistic (using the contingency table method).
(c) Find the critical value (using the contingency table method).
(d) Using the z-test for proportions, find the value of the test statistic (and verify that z 2 2
= χ , when there is one
degree of freedom).
(e) Find the p-value.
